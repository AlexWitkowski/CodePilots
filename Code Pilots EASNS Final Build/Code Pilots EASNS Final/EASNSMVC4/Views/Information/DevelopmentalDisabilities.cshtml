    Dyslexia can affect people differently. This depends, in part, upon the severity of the learning disability and the success of alternate learning methods. Some with dyslexia can have trouble with reading and spelling, while others struggle to write, or to tell left from right. Some children show few signs of difficulty with early reading and writing. But later on, they may have trouble with complex language skills, such as grammar, reading comprehension and more in-depth writing.
    <br><br>
    Dyslexia can also make it difficult for people to express themselves clearly. It can be hard for them to use vocabulary and to structure their thoughts during conversation. Others struggle to understand when people speak to them. This isn't due to hearing problems. Instead, it's from trouble processing verbal information. It becomes even harder with abstract thoughts and non-literal language, such as jokes and proverbs.<br><br>
    <b>Here are some strategies to follow when dealing with someone who has Dyslexia: </b>
    <br /><b>Acquisition of knowledge</b>
    <ol>
        <li>Be as concrete and explicit as possible</li>
        <li>Ascertain the learner’s ideal learning and instructional style</li>
        <li>Use visual demonstration along with verbally taught material to teach new information</li>
        <li>Present novel material in small chunks</li>
        <li>Repetition of information can be an asset and will help the learner consolidate the material</li>
        <li>Design material to be taught in a way that makes it more personal to the learner</li>
        <li>Make certain through frequent checks that the learner is comprehending</li>
        <li>Continual reinforce information through various mediums (visual and auditory aids)</li>
        <li>Allow for time for review</li>
        <li>Give the student immediate feedback</li>
        <li>Teach the learner life skills-often with developmental disabilities they need assistance in hygiene care, feeding, social and other life skills</li>
    </ol>
    <br /><b>Memory</b>
    <ol>
        <li>Try and develop links between new information and prior knowledge</li>
        <li>Instruct and teach students to chunk information into smaller bits of material to assist in retention</li>
        <li>Help students generate ways to link memories-memory cues that are personal and meaningful for them</li>
        <li>Repetition of material is an asset</li>
        <li>Generate an environment where students do not have to rely heavily on memory</li>
        <li>Teach learners to use memory aids (e.g., calendars, day timer, Black Berry, cheat sheets)</li>
        <li>Create work/assignment sheets to be carried with them-back this up with a helper or teacher ensuring that it is filled in properly</li>
        <li>Use multi-modalities (visual, tackle, and visual cues)</li>
        <li>Use rhyme, poems, and songs where applicable</li>
        <li>Chunk work into smaller more manageable pieces</li>
    </ol>
    <br /><b>Organization</b>
    <ol>
        <li>Set up and maintain daily routines</li>
        <li>Provide written daily schedules and review them at the start of each day with the learner</li>
        <li>Often times students with developmental disabilities are not able to make notes and follow an outline; however if the student is at this level provide an outline of class lecture and have the students make notes</li>
        <li>Keep duplicate copies of assignments and materials for students who misplace their work</li>
        <li>Break complex task into smaller more easily managed task-write a checklist of steps for completing each step in reaching the goal</li>
        <li>Teach study skills</li>
        <li>Uncluttered work-space</li>
    </ol>
    <br /><b>Attention</b>
    <ol>
        <li>Provide an environment with minimal distraction</li>
        <li>Break information and material into smaller chuncks</li>
        <li>Put student away from areas that may distract them (i.e., windows and doors)</li>
        <li>Be consistent with routines</li>
        <li>Let them know when you are going to have them shift their attention to a new subject</li>
    </ol>
    <br /><b>Perception/Vision</b>
    <ol>
        <li>An environment that is or is not visual stimulating would depend on the learners needs-this will take trial and error in some cases (e.g. a Snozalum room may be adjusted accordingly and may provide relaxation or stress)</li>
        <li>Create an environment that is not too visual stimulating or busy</li>
        <li>Highlight important information</li>
        <li>Use a multi-sensory approach when teaching where possible</li>
        <li>Use visual aids, such as pictures to help the learner communicate-point to or have the learner point at the picture (i.e. toilet)</li>
        <li>Post class schedules and rules so the learner can refer to them</li>
        <li>Try and make sure the learner has an unobtrusive view</li>
        <li>Provide repeat and longer viewing times</li>
        <li>Try and maintain a clean workspace</li>
    </ol>
    <br /><b>Perception Auditory</b>
    <ol>
        <li>Allow for more time for the learner to process information and provide and answer</li>
        <li>Try and keep classroom noise to a minimal</li>
        <li>Eye contact may cause some learner to feel uncomfortable –understand your learner before engaging in eye contact</li>
        <li>Use a multi-Sensory approach when teaching</li>
        <li>Highlight important materials and information</li>
        <li>Be explicit with directions and check for comprehension</li>
        <li>Touch may distract the learner and may be unwelcome. As well, the learner may not understand who or who they cannot touch-use touch with caution</li>
        <li>Position the student for maximum hearing</li>
    </ol>
    <br /><b>Reasoning</b>
    <ol>
        <li>Provide concreate and explicit examples</li>
        <li>Confirm comprehension</li>
        <li>Use modelling, talking aloud, rehearsal, and role playing to teach reasoning skills and understanding</li>
    </ol>
    <br /><b>Problem Solving</b>
    <ol>
        <li>Involve the learner in the strategies process-help them discover what they feel may be working or not</li>
        <li>Provide promts to strategy use</li>
        <li>Break down the problems into smaller steps-use step-by-step problem solving strategies</li>
        <li>Coach and aid learners in the generation of solutions</li>
    </ol>
