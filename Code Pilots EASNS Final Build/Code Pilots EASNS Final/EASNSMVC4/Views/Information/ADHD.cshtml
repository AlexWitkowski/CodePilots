<p class="contentText">
    Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common childhood brain disorders and can continue through adolescence and adulthood. Symptoms include difficulty staying focused and paying attention, difficulty controlling behaviour, and hyperactivity (over-activity). These symptoms can make it difficult for a child with ADHD to succeed in school, get along with other children or adults, or finish tasks at home.<br><br>
    <b>Here are some strategies to follow when dealing with someone who has ADHD: </b>
    <br /><b>Frustration</b>
    <ol>
        <li>Try and provide structures and routine. The more a learner can predict and expect, the less frustration</li>
        <li>Try and identify antecedents to frustration-so that they can either be eliminated and or modified</li>
        <li>Create opportunities for success</li>
        <li>Monitor work closely and provide feedback often</li>
        <li>Provide an alternative for acting out a place they can go when they feel frustrated</li>
        <li>Help other students identify the signs of frustration so that frustration may be more quickly diffused</li>
        <li>Try and identify when it is time to take a break and do something different</li>
    </ol>
    <br /><b>Disinhibition</b>
    <ol>
        <li>Provide opportunities for open, and safe communication</li>
        <li>Teach turn taking while taking increase time delay between turns</li>
        <li>Make staff aware of students and how to behave with them</li>
        <li>Role-model and role paly appropriate behaviour</li>
        <li>Be explicit when teaching social behaviour</li>
        <li>When possible practice ahead of time for new social situations and in the setting in which it will occur</li>
    </ol>
    <br /><b>Aggression</b>
    <ol>
        <li>Know and monitor any potentially aggressive situation for the safety of others around, look for signals(change in body posture, increase and rapid verbal expression)</li>
        <li>Help students to develop self-monitoring strategies and when they feel angry to go for a walk or to a quiet place</li>
        <li>Re-direct the learner to another thought, or task</li>
        <li>Use proximity control</li>
        <li>Try and identify and eliminate triggers</li>
        <li>Be prepared and up to date in non-violent crisis intervention</li>
        <li>Have a plan in palce to deal with aggressive situations</li>
    </ol>
    <br /><b>Poor Self-Esteem</b>
    <ol>
        <li>Focus on what the learner can do</li>
        <li>Make sure that academic goals can be achieved and that the learner will be successful</li>
        <li>Aid the learner to recognize their limitations and help them find methods to compensate for them</li>
    </ol>
